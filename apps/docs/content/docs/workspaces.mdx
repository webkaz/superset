title: Workspaces
description: Isolated environments for each git branch
---

## Core Concept

Each workspace = one git branch. Workspaces are isolated git worktrees with their own directory, terminal, and ports.

## Create Workspaces

Press **⌘N** or click "New Workspace". Create from:

- **New branch** - Fresh branch from main
- **Existing branch** - Continue work on a branch
- **Pull request** - Review or continue a PR

Each workspace gets:
- Own git branch
- Own working directory
- Own terminal sessions
- Own port range

## Use Cases

- **Parallel features** - Work on multiple features simultaneously
- **AI agents** - Run Claude Code in separate workspaces
- **Code review** - Review PRs while continuing your work

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/auth`, `fix/login-bug`
- Don't work directly on `main`
- Delete workspaces after merging
