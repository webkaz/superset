## What is Superset?

Superset is a desktop app for managing multiple codebases with git worktrees. Work on several branches simultaneously, each in its own isolated workspace.

## Key Features

- **Workspaces** - Each branch gets its own directory via git worktrees. No more stashing.
- **Terminal** - Built-in terminal with persistent sessions per workspace.
- **Diff Viewer** - Review changes, stage files, commit, and push.
- **AI Agents** - Run Claude Code or other agents in isolated workspaces.
- **IDE Integration** - Open any workspace in Cursor or VS Code.

## How It Works

Superset uses [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to give each branch its own directory. Switch contexts instantly without losing your place.

Your data stays local. Superset works offline and syncs when connected.
