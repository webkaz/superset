## Add a Repository

Add your repo from a local folder or Git URL. Requires GitHub auth (`gh auth status`).

## Create a Workspace

Each workspace is an isolated git worktree on its own branch. Superset only copies git-tracked files—use [setup scripts](/setup-teardown-scripts) for `.env` files or `bun install`.

Create workspaces from:
- New branch from main
- Existing branch
- Pull request

## Start Working

- **⌘O** - Open in Cursor/VS Code
- **Terminal** - Built-in terminal ready to use
- **Changes** - View diffs and commit

## Next Steps

- [Setup Scripts](/setup-teardown-scripts) - Automate `bun install`, env files
- [Workspaces](/workspaces) - Run multiple branches at once
- [IDE Integration](/use-with-ide) - Configure your editor
