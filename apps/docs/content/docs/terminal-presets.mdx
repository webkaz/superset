## Overview

Presets let you quickly launch terminals with pre-configured commands. Save common workflows and apply them with a single click.

## What Presets Do

- **Custom commands for new tabs** - Define commands that run when opening a terminal
- **Working directory** - Specify where commands run in your project (e.g., `apps/web`)
- **Sequential or parallel execution** - Run commands one after another, or in split panes
- **Default preset** - Auto-apply a preset to new workspaces
- **Quick-add templates** - One-click setup for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and other agents

## Creating a Preset

Go to **Settings → Terminal** and click **Add Preset**.

Each preset has:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the preset |
| **Description** | Optional description |
| **Working Directory** | Relative path in your project (leave empty for root) |
| **Commands** | One or more commands to run |
| **Mode** | Sequential (&&) or Parallel (split panes) |

## Execution Modes

**Sequential** - Commands run one after another in a single terminal, joined with `&&`:

```bash
bun install && bun dev
```

**Parallel** - Each command runs in its own split pane within a single tab. Useful for running a dev server and tests simultaneously.

## Quick-Add Templates

Pre-configured presets for popular AI agents:

- **claude** - `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`
- **codex** - Full danger mode with high reasoning effort
- **gemini** - `gemini --yolo`
- **cursor-agent** - Cursor AI agent
- **opencode** - Open-source AI coding agent

## Default Preset

Mark a preset as default to auto-apply it when creating workspaces or opening new tabs.

**Auto-apply settings** in Settings → Terminal:
- **Apply preset on workspace creation** - Runs default preset when creating new workspaces
- **Apply preset on new tab** - Runs default preset when opening new terminal tabs/panes/splits

Both settings are enabled by default. Disable either to prevent automatic preset application in that context.

Explicit preset launches (via hotkey or menu) always work regardless of these settings.
