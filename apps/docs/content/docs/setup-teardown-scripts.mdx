title: Setup & Teardown Scripts
description: Automate workspace initialization
---

## Overview

Run commands automatically when creating or deleting workspaces.

Create `.superset/config.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "setup": ["bun install", "cp \"$SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH/.env\" .env"],
  "teardown": ["docker-compose down"]
}
```

## How It Works

1. Create workspace → setup commands run
2. Delete workspace → teardown commands run

Commands run sequentially in the workspace directory.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH` | Path to root repository |
| `SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_NAME` | Current workspace name |

## Examples

**Node.js:**
```json
{ "setup": ["bun install", "cp \"$SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH/.env\" .env"] }
```

**Docker:**
```json
{
  "setup": ["docker-compose up -d", "bun run db:migrate"],
  "teardown": ["docker-compose down -v"]
}
```

## User Overrides

Override project setup/teardown scripts without modifying the repo by placing a `config.json` in your home directory:

```
~/.superset/projects/<project-id>/config.json
```

Where `<project-id>` is your project's unique ID in Superset (visible in the app's project settings).

### Priority Order

Config is resolved in this order (first found wins, for both setup and teardown):
1. `~/.superset/projects/<project-id>/config.json` — user override
2. `<worktree>/.superset/config.json` — worktree-specific
3. `<repo>/.superset/config.json` — project default

No merging occurs between levels—the first config found is used entirely.

### Examples

**Custom setup script:**
```json
{
  "setup": ["~/.superset/projects/<project-id>/setup.sh"],
  "teardown": ["~/.superset/projects/<project-id>/teardown.sh"]
}
```

**Skip setup entirely:**
```json
{ "setup": [], "teardown": [] }
```

## Force Delete

If teardown scripts fail during workspace deletion, you can force-delete to skip the failed teardown and continue cleanup.

When teardown fails:
1. Error toast appears with "Delete Anyway" and "View Logs" buttons
2. Click "Delete Anyway" to force-delete immediately
3. Or click "View Logs" to review the failure, then force-delete from the dialog

## Tips

- Keep setup fast—runs every workspace creation
- Commit `.superset/` to share with team
- Use shell scripts for complex logic: `"setup": ["./.superset/setup.sh"]`
- Use user overrides to customize scripts without creating git noise
