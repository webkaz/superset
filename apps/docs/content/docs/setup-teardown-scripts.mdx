title: Setup & Teardown Scripts
description: Automate workspace initialization
---

## Overview

Run commands automatically when creating or deleting workspaces.

Create `.superset/config.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "setup": ["bun install", "cp \"$SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH/.env\" .env"],
  "teardown": ["docker-compose down"]
}
```

## How It Works

1. Create workspace → setup commands run
2. Delete workspace → teardown commands run

Commands run sequentially in the workspace directory.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH` | Path to root repository |
| `SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_NAME` | Current workspace name |

## Examples

**Node.js:**
```json
{ "setup": ["bun install", "cp \"$SUPERSET_ROOT_PATH/.env\" .env"] }
```

**Docker:**
```json
{
  "setup": ["docker-compose up -d", "bun run db:migrate"],
  "teardown": ["docker-compose down -v"]
}
```

## Tips

- Keep setup fast—runs every workspace creation
- Commit `.superset/` to share with team
- Use shell scripts for complex logic: `"setup": ["./.superset/setup.sh"]`
