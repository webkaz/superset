## Focus Mode

Review one file at a time with navigation controls.

Toggle focus mode in the diff toolbar (target icon) to:
- View a single file with minimal distraction
- Navigate between files with Prev/Next buttons
- Jump between sections (Against base, Commits, Staged, Unstaged) via the section dropdown
- See per-section file counts and position (e.g., "2/5 in Staged")

Click files in the sidebar to jump directly to them in focus mode.
