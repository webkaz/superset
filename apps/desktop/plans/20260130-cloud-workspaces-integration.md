## Architecture: Bridge Pattern

Based on [ColeMurray/background-agents](https://github.com/ColeMurray/background-agents) and [Ramp's blog post](https://builders.ramp.com/post/why-we-built-our-background-agent):

### Data Flow
```
User → Web App → Control Plane (WebSocket) → Sandbox (WebSocket) → Claude
                       ↑                           ↓
                       └────── Events ─────────────┘
```

### Key Files
- `packages/control-plane/src/session/durable-object.ts` - Session DO with SQLite, history, events
- `packages/control-plane/src/types.ts` - Type definitions including HistoricalMessage
- `packages/sandbox/app.py` - Modal sandbox with Claude CLI execution
- `apps/web/src/app/cloud/page.tsx` - Cloud home page
- `apps/web/src/app/cloud/new/page.tsx` - New session page
- `apps/web/src/app/cloud/[sessionId]/page.tsx` - Session detail page
- `apps/web/src/app/cloud/[sessionId]/hooks/useCloudSession.ts` - WebSocket hook with history
- `apps/web/src/app/cloud/[sessionId]/components/CloudWorkspaceContent/` - Session UI

## Completed - Sprint 2 (Chat Polish)

### Phase 5: Tool Call Display ✅
- [x] `lib/tool-formatters.ts` - Format tool calls with summary + icon
- [x] `ToolCallItem/` - Collapsible item with chevron + icon + summary + time
- [x] `ToolCallGroup/` - Groups consecutive same-type tool calls
- [x] `ToolIcon/` - SVG icons for each tool type

### Phase 6-8: Processing & Connection States ✅
- [x] `isProcessing` state - tracks when prompt being executed
- [x] `isSandboxReady` computed from sandboxStatus
- [x] Auto-spawn sandbox when status is "stopped"
- [x] Disable input when sandbox not ready (syncing/spawning)
- [x] Dynamic placeholder text based on state
- [x] Processing indicator ("Claude is working...")
- [x] Sandbox status badge with spawning state

### Phase 7: Markdown Rendering ✅
- [x] `react-markdown` with `remark-gfm`
- [x] Custom code block styling
- [x] Inline code styling

### Phase 9: WebSocket Hook Improvements ✅
- [x] `isReconnecting` state
- [x] `reconnectAttempt` counter (shown as "Reconnecting (2/5)...")
- [x] Error message when max reconnects exceeded

## Pending - Sprint 2 (Remaining)

## Pending - Sprint 3 (GitHub Integration)

### Phase 10: GitHub Repo Connection (Priority: High)
User needs to connect GitHub repos in the app.

**Current state:** Have `repository.create` tRPC but no GitHub fetch flow

**Flow to implement:**
1. [ ] Check existing GitHub integration in `packages/trpc/src/router/github/`
2. [ ] Add "Connect Repository" button in `/cloud/new` page
3. [ ] Dialog/sheet to show user's GitHub repos
4. [ ] Fetch repos via GitHub API (user token from auth)
5. [ ] Save selected repos to organization via `repository.create`

### Phase 11: Quick Repo Selector on Home Page (Priority: Medium)
Add repo dropdown to home page for quick session creation.

- [ ] Repository dropdown above/beside the prompt input
- [ ] Flow: select repo → type prompt → create session → redirect → send prompt
- [ ] Recent repos as quick-select chips

### Phase 12: Branch Management (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Fetch branches via GitHub API
- [ ] Branch selector in new session form
- [ ] Show repo's default branch

## Pending - Sprint 4 (Layout & Polish)

### Phase 13: Right Sidebar (Session Details)
- [ ] Session metadata: model, created time, duration
- [ ] Sandbox status with real-time updates
- [ ] Repository info with GitHub link
- [ ] PR link when created (from artifacts)
- [ ] Files changed (aggregate from tool calls)

### Phase 14: Artifacts System (Priority: Low)
Reference: background-agents stores PRs as artifacts

- [ ] Artifact type: PR with state (open/merged/closed/draft)
- [ ] Display PR badge in sidebar
- [ ] Link to GitHub PR
- [ ] Screenshot artifacts (future)

### Phase 15: Session Lifecycle
- [ ] Delete session
- [ ] Session title editing (inline)
- [ ] Session archiving

### Phase 16: Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] `⌘+Enter` to send prompt
- [ ] `Escape` to stop execution
- [ ] `⌘+K` to focus input
- [ ] `⌘+\` to toggle sidebar
