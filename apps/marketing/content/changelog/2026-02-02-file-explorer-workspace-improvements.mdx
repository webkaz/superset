## Performance & Memory Leak Fixes

This release focuses on stability and speed improvements across the app.

**Workspace deletion 12x faster** - Deletion now completes in ~4-5 seconds instead of ~60 seconds. Terminal shutdowns and cleanup run in parallel, and git worktree removal uses a non-blocking background process. <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1120" />

**Port scanning performance** - Batched port scans per interval to reduce CPU usage and improve responsiveness <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1134" />

**Memory leak fixes** - Fixed memory leaks in terminal session management and workspace cleanup routines, reducing memory usage during long sessions

**xterm viewport fixes** - Resolved terminal viewport height issues that caused rendering problems <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1133" />

## File Explorer <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1112" />

Browse and manage your project files directly from the right sidebar. The new file explorer includes a hierarchical tree view, search functionality, and full file operations.

- Create, rename, delete, move, and copy files with context menus
- Toggle hidden files and refresh directory listings
- Search files with instant results and collapsible tree navigation
