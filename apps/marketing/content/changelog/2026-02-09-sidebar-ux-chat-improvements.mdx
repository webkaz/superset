## New Diff View, Powered by diffs.com <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1308" />

The Changes view has been completely rebuilt with [Pierre Computer's diffs.com](https://diffs.com) engine — delivering a drastically improved diff experience in both UI and performance. Large changesets that previously lagged now render instantly, and the new interface makes reviewing diffs feel native and fluid.

The new viewer includes an edit mode toggle — switch between read-only review and live editing, and hit Ctrl+S to save changes directly from the diff.

- **Workspace-scoped base branch** — base branch selection is now per-workspace instead of global, so diffs always compare against the right branch <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1329" />
- **Preserved file explorer state** — expanded folders, scroll position, and selection persist when switching between Changes and Files tabs <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1297" />
- **Compact tab buttons** — Changes and Files tabs collapse to icon-only mode with tooltips when the sidebar is narrow <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1334" />

## Early Preview of Chat GUI <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1309" />

A native AI chat interface built right into Superset — and it works with your existing Claude Code sessions. Pick up where you left off without switching windows.

- **Existing session support** — scan and restore previous Claude Code sessions so you never lose context
- **Slash commands** — type `/` to browse available commands with fuzzy search and keyboard navigation
- **File mentions** — tag files with `@` and fuzzy search to pull in exactly the context you need <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1307" />
- **Rich tool rendering** — tool calls display with specialized UI for bash output, web searches, file diffs, and user questions
- **Session persistence** — chat sessions survive app restarts with local storage and automatic restore <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1287" />

This is an early preview — general availability is coming next week. We'd love your feedback in the meantime.

## Powerful Preset Settings <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1320" />

Terminal presets now have granular auto-apply controls. Configure when presets run independently for workspace creation and new tabs — so you can auto-run setup commands on new workspaces without them firing every time you open a tab.

- **Apply preset on workspace creation** — controls initialization commands when spinning up workspaces
- **Apply preset on new tab** — controls whether presets run when opening new tabs, panes, or splits
- Explicit preset launches via hotkey or menu always work regardless of these settings

## Improvements

- **Improved new tab buttons** — grouped outline button bar for New Terminal and New Chat with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+T, Cmd+Shift+T) <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1321" />
- **Setup script card** — persistent sidebar card replaces toast for missing setup scripts with direct link to configuration <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1270" />
- **Push auto-setup** — first `git push` from worktrees automatically creates remote branch and sets upstream tracking <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1267" />
- **Project image toggle** — hide/show project GitHub avatars in sidebar with colored initial letters as fallback <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1276" />
- **Teardown logs modal** — failed teardown scripts show logs in a modal instead of dumping output in error toast <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1277" />
