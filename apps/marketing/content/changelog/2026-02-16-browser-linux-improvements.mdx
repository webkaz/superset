## Chat - Still in preview <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1413" />

Chat got a major upgrade this week. Streaming responses now support interactive tool-approval flows, so you can review and approve each tool call as it happens. A new multi-provider model picker lets you choose between providers and models. Agent and tool calls render as expandable UI blocks with tool-specific displays, and a new web search tool lets Claude fetch and reference live content.

We also shipped a series of fixes to MCP connectivity — replacing the stagnant `mcp-handler` library with a direct SDK transport <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1518" />, fixing OAuth connections through the reverse proxy <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1512" />, and resolving SDK version conflicts that caused session failures <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1515" /> <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1516" />.

## In-App Browser <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1519" />

Browse documentation, preview dev servers, and test web apps without leaving Superset. The new embedded browser includes Chrome-like URL autocomplete with browsing history, favicon capture, and DevTools support.

- Navigate directly from detected ports — click the external link icon to open in a browser pane instead of your system browser
- URL bar with persistent history and keyboard navigation
- Clear browsing data from the overflow menu
- Open browser tabs with Cmd+Shift+B hotkey

## Desktop Automation Tools <PRBadge url="https://github.com/superset-sh/superset/pull/1481" />

Added MCP-based automation tools that let Claude Code interact with the Superset UI programmatically. Claude can now take screenshots, click UI elements, type into fields, and inspect the DOM — enabling fully automated testing and debugging workflows through natural language.
