I like fighting in most forms. I like to watch fights, train fighting, compete, and watch breakdowns. Here's something I learned in training and sparring that I feel is applicable to my own life, perhaps in startups and competition.

### Learning how to get hit
The first thing I try to learn when learning a new martial art, whether it’s BJJ (Brazilian jiujutsu), Muay Thai, or something else, is how to play defense. In jiujutsu, if you’re new, you’ll be working from your back a lot. In Muay Thai, you get punched in the face. 

When getting punched in the face, the natural response is to close your eyes, flinch, crouch, or turn your back. These are all bad. When you do any of these, your opponent has even more advantage to continue punching you since you can’t see them. It’s easier to punch someone when they can’t see you (source required). 

Learning how to get hit is learning how to fight against these natural urges. Instead of closing your eyes, you should keep them open such that you can see the next punches coming. Instead of crouching or turning away, you should face them, shell up, or step away while still looking at them. Knowing how to get it and not panic will allow you to figure out how to react. 

### What to do after getting hit
After you get hit, there are many good options, I will just focus on my favorite option. Hit them back. Hitting your opponent back disrupts their flow, now instead of focusing on hitting you, they have to focus on not getting hit. It’s harder to hit someone when you’re also getting hit (source also required). 

It’s also better to not just hit them back once, but hit them back multiple times. If your opponent lands one shot but receives multiple shots in return, they might want to think twice about throwing another shot. 

### Conclusion
I’m far from an expert in fighting, but I get to train with many experts who are much better than me. Hence, I get punched in the face a lot. I find these tips helpful for getting punched in the face and in other equivalent aspects of my life. 

If many people equate starting a company as getting punched in the face, at least now you know how to get punched in the face and how to do something about it.
