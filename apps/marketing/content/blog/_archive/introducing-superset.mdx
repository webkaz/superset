We're excited to introduce Superset - a new way to work with AI coding agents.

## The Problem

Modern AI coding assistants are powerful, but they have a fundamental limitation: you can only run one task at a time. When your agent is working on a complex feature, you're stuck waiting. Context switching between different projects means losing your train of thought.

## The Solution

Superset lets you run **10+ parallel coding agents** on your machine. Here's what that means for your workflow:

- **Spin up new tasks** while waiting for your current agent to finish
- **Quickly switch between tasks** as they need your attention
- **Keep your context** across multiple projects and features

## How It Works

Superset uses isolated workspaces powered by git worktrees. Each task runs in its own environment, with its own terminal, its own files, and its own agent context.

```bash
# Create a new workspace for a feature
superset create --branch feature/auth

# Your agent works in isolation
# Meanwhile, start another task...
superset create --branch feature/dashboard
```

## What's Next

We're just getting started. In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more about:

- Deep integrations with popular AI coding tools
- Advanced workspace management features
- Team collaboration capabilities

Stay tuned for updates.
