Git worktrees have become an essential tool for developers managing multiple tasks simultaneously. But where did they come from, and why are they suddenly so relevant?

## The Early Days

Git worktrees were introduced in Git 2.5 (July 2015) as a way to have multiple working directories attached to a single repository. Before worktrees, developers had two options for working on multiple branches simultaneously:

1. **Stash and switch** - Constantly stashing changes and switching branches
2. **Multiple clones** - Maintaining separate clones of the same repository

Both approaches had significant drawbacks. Stashing was error-prone and disruptive. Multiple clones wasted disk space and made it difficult to share local commits between workspaces.

## How Worktrees Work

A git worktree creates a new working directory that shares the same `.git` directory as your main repository. This means:

- All branches and commits are instantly available
- No need to push/pull between directories
- Minimal disk space overhead
- Each worktree can have its own branch checked out

```bash
# Create a new worktree
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature/new-feature

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree
git worktree remove ../feature-branch
```

## The AI Agent Revolution

With the rise of AI coding agents, worktrees have found a new purpose. When you're running multiple agents in parallel, each one needs:

- Its own working directory
- Isolation from other agents' changes
- Access to the full repository history

Worktrees provide all of this out of the box. That's why Superset uses them as the foundation for parallel agent workspaces.

## Best Practices

When using worktrees for parallel development:

- **Use descriptive paths** - Name your worktree directories after the feature or task
- **Clean up regularly** - Remove worktrees when you're done with them
- **Avoid long-lived worktrees** - Merge or rebase frequently to avoid drift

## Conclusion

What started as a niche feature for advanced Git users has become essential infrastructure for the age of AI-assisted development. As coding agents become more capable, the ability to run them in parallel—powered by git worktrees—will only become more important.
