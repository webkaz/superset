Superset and Warp both help developers work with AI in the terminal, but they solve different problems. Warp is a modern terminal emulator with built-in AI agents. Superset is an orchestration layer for running many CLI-based coding agents in parallel, each in its own isolated Git worktree.

## At a Glance

| | **Superset** | **Warp** |
|---|---|---|
| **Category** | Agent orchestration terminal | AI-powered terminal emulator |
| **What it does** | Runs 10+ AI coding agents in parallel with Git worktree isolation | Modern terminal with built-in AI agents, code editing, and collaboration |
| **AI approach** | Agent-agnostic — works with Claude Code, Codex, Aider, or any CLI agent | Built-in agents (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google); supports BYOK and third-party CLI agents |
| **Parallelism** | Core feature — every task gets its own worktree and branch | Agents run in terminal panes via Agent Management Panel |
| **Pricing** | Free tier + Pro $20/seat/mo | Free tier (limited credits), Build $20/mo, Business $50/mo |
| **Open source** | Yes (Apache 2.0), no telemetry | No (closed-source) |

## What Is Superset?

Superset is a desktop app for orchestrating AI coding agents. You spin up 10+ agents on separate tasks simultaneously, each in its own Git worktree with a dedicated branch and working directory. When one finishes, you review the diff and merge. Superset ships no AI model — you bring Claude Code, Codex, Aider, or any CLI agent. It handles parallel execution, worktree isolation, terminal persistence, and code review. Fully local, no telemetry, open source under Apache 2.0.

## What Is Warp?

Warp is a Rust-based, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that evolved into an Agentic Development Environment. Warp 2.0 added built-in AI agents, a code editor with diff review, and Warp Drive for team knowledge sharing. Agent Mode takes natural language prompts, runs multi-step workflows, and self-corrects on errors. Agents 3.0 lets agents interact with REPLs, debuggers, and interactive CLI tools. Available on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Key Differences

### Built-In Agents vs Bring-Your-Own

Warp ships its own agents — type a prompt, get results, no external tools to install. Superset includes no AI agent. You install Claude Code, Codex, or Aider yourself, and Superset runs them in parallel. Warp is more convenient out of the box; Superset gives you complete freedom over which agent, model, and provider you use.

### Parallelism and Isolation

Both tools support multiple agents, but the isolation model differs. Superset gives each agent a dedicated Git worktree — separate branch, separate working directory — so agents cannot modify each other's files. Warp runs agents in terminal panes on your file system directly. For a few agents on unrelated tasks, that works. For ten agents on the same codebase, worktree isolation prevents conflicts.

### Terminal Quality vs Orchestration Focus

Warp is a polished terminal — GPU-accelerated, with block-based output and a command palette. Superset embeds terminals (xterm.js) for running agents but is not designed to replace your daily-driver terminal. You would still use Warp, iTerm2, or Kitty for SSH and ad-hoc commands.

### Team Collaboration

Warp has team features via Warp Drive: shared commands, notebooks, environment variables, plus Slack/Linear/GitHub integrations. Superset has no team collaboration features.

---

## Pricing

Superset offers a free tier and Pro at $20/seat/month. You also pay for the API keys your chosen agents consume.

Warp's terminal features are free. AI features require the Build plan ($20/month, 1,500 credits) or BYOK. Business runs $50/user/month with SSO and zero data retention.

## Which Should You Choose?

**Choose Warp if you:**
- Want an all-in-one terminal with built-in AI agents, code editing, and team tools
- Value terminal polish — GPU rendering, block output, command palette
- Need cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Prefer built-in agents that work without configuring external tools

**Choose Superset if you:**
- Run many coding agents in parallel and need Git-level isolation between them
- Want full control over which agent and model you use, with no lock-in
- Require local-only, open-source tooling with zero telemetry
- Already have a terminal you like and need an orchestration layer on top

These tools complement each other. Use Warp as your daily terminal and Superset for parallel agent orchestration across worktrees.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Superset a replacement for Warp?

No. Superset does not handle SSH, ad-hoc commands, or interactive tools. It is a specialized orchestration layer for running AI coding agents in parallel. You can use both: Warp for daily terminal work, Superset for parallel agent workflows.

### Does Warp isolate agents with Git worktrees?

No. Warp agents operate on your file system directly. If two agents modify the same file concurrently, conflicts can arise. Superset prevents this by giving each agent its own worktree, branch, and directory.

### Can I run Claude Code or Codex in both tools?

Yes. Warp runs them in terminal panes alongside its built-in agents. Superset runs them in isolated Git worktrees with parallel execution as the core workflow. For one or two agents, either works. For ten agents on ten tasks with branch isolation, Superset is purpose-built for that.
