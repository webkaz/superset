GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that lives inside your editor, offering inline completions and chat. Superset is a terminal that runs many AI coding agents in parallel, each in its own Git worktree. They target different workflows: Copilot assists you line-by-line as you type, Superset dispatches autonomous agents to work on entire tasks independently.

## At a Glance

| | **Superset** | **GitHub Copilot** |
|---|---|---|
| **Category** | Agent orchestration terminal | AI pair programmer (editor extension) |
| **What it does** | Runs 10+ coding agents in parallel with Git worktree isolation | Inline code completions, chat, and Copilot Agent mode in your editor |
| **AI approach** | Agent-agnostic — orchestrates any CLI agent | Multiple models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) via GitHub |
| **Parallelism** | Core feature — many agents on separate branches simultaneously | Single-threaded; Copilot Coding Agent runs one task at a time in cloud |
| **Editor** | Works alongside any editor | VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim (extension) |
| **Pricing** | Free tier + Pro $20/seat/mo | Free tier (limited), Pro $10/mo, Business $19/user/mo, Enterprise $39/user/mo |
| **Open source** | Yes (Apache 2.0) | No (closed source) |

## What Is Superset?

Superset is a desktop terminal that orchestrates CLI-based coding agents in parallel across isolated Git worktrees. Each agent — Claude Code, Codex, Aider, OpenCode — gets its own branch and working directory. A persistent daemon manages sessions so they survive crashes. Includes a built-in diff viewer and integrates with VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, and Xcode. Open source (Apache 2.0) with zero telemetry.

## What Is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant from GitHub (Microsoft). It integrates into your editor as an extension, providing inline code completions (ghost text as you type), a chat panel for questions and code generation, and Copilot Agent mode that can make multi-file changes autonomously. Copilot also offers a cloud-based Coding Agent that creates PRs from GitHub Issues. It uses multiple models including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini, accessible through GitHub's infrastructure.

## Key Differences

### Inline Assistant vs Parallel Orchestrator

Copilot is built for the editing experience — it completes your code as you type, answers questions in a chat panel, and can make changes across files via Agent mode. Superset runs many autonomous agents simultaneously, each on a separate task in a separate worktree. Copilot makes you faster at writing code; Superset makes many agents work in parallel while you do something else.

### Completions vs Autonomous Tasks

Copilot's primary interaction is inline completion: you type, it suggests. Its Agent mode and Coding Agent can handle larger tasks, but the core experience is real-time assistance while you code. Superset dispatches fully autonomous tasks — "refactor the payment service," "add tests for the auth module" — and agents work independently until done.

### Editor Integration vs Editor Independence

Copilot lives inside your editor (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim). Superset is a separate terminal that works alongside any editor. This means Copilot can assist with editing-specific features (completions, inline diffs), while Superset focuses on orchestration and isolation without caring which editor you use.

### Model and Agent Flexibility

Copilot supports multiple models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) through GitHub's infrastructure. Superset supports any CLI-based agent — and by extension, whatever models those agents support. The difference is direct vs proxied: with Superset, you bring your own API keys and pay providers directly. With Copilot, you use GitHub's model access through their pricing tiers.

### Privacy

Superset runs entirely locally — no telemetry, code stays on your machine. Copilot sends code context to GitHub/Microsoft servers for processing. Copilot Business and Enterprise offer data retention controls, but code still transits external servers. Superset's open-source codebase is fully auditable.

---

## Pricing

Superset offers a free tier and Pro at $20/seat/month, plus your agents' API costs. GitHub Copilot offers Free (limited), Pro ($10/mo or $100/year), Business ($19/user/mo), and Enterprise ($39/user/mo). Copilot's pricing includes model access; Superset's doesn't (you pay agents' API costs separately).

## Which Should You Choose?

**Choose GitHub Copilot if you:**
- Want real-time inline code completions as you type
- Prefer AI assistance integrated directly into your editor
- Work primarily in VS Code or JetBrains
- Want a simple, low-cost AI assistant ($10/mo) that improves your editing speed

**Choose Superset if you:**
- Run CLI-based coding agents and want to parallelize across 10+ tasks
- Need autonomous agents working on separate tasks while you do other work
- Want agent and model flexibility with no vendor lock-in
- Need code to stay local with zero telemetry
- Work on large codebases where parallel execution saves hours

**Use both** for the best of each: Copilot for inline completions while you code, Superset to dispatch parallel agents for larger tasks. They don't overlap — Copilot helps you write code faster, Superset helps you scale agent work wider.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Superset a Copilot replacement?

No. Superset does not provide inline completions, code suggestions, or editor integration. It orchestrates autonomous coding agents in parallel. Use Copilot for real-time editing assistance and Superset for parallel autonomous tasks.

### How does Copilot's Coding Agent compare to Superset?

Copilot's Coding Agent runs in a cloud VM and creates PRs from GitHub Issues — one task at a time per repository. Superset runs many agents locally in parallel across Git worktrees. Copilot's agent is cloud-hosted and GitHub-integrated; Superset's approach is local, agent-agnostic, and parallel.

### Can I use Copilot inside a Superset worktree?

Yes. When you open a Superset worktree in VS Code, Copilot works normally — it sees the worktree as a regular git repository. You get Copilot's completions while reviewing or editing agent output.

### Is Superset open source?

Yes. Superset is open source under Apache 2.0 with zero telemetry. GitHub Copilot is closed source.
