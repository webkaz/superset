Superset and Conductor both run multiple AI coding agents in parallel using Git worktrees for isolation. They differ sharply in agent support, architecture, and openness.

## At a Glance

| | **Superset** | **Conductor** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it does** | Runs 10+ AI agents in parallel with Git worktree isolation | Runs Claude Code / Codex agents in parallel with Git worktree isolation |
| **Agent support** | Any CLI agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Aider, etc.) | Claude Code and OpenAI Codex only |
| **Open source** | Yes (Apache 2.0) | No (closed source) |
| **Terminal architecture** | Persistent daemon (survives app restarts) | Standard sessions (do not survive restarts) |
| **Integrations** | VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, Xcode | Linear, GitHub PRs |
| **Platform** | macOS (Electron) | macOS (Apple Silicon required) |
| **Pricing** | Free tier + Pro $20/seat/mo | Free |

## What Is Superset?

Superset is a desktop terminal for orchestrating AI coding agents. It runs any CLI-based agent -- Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Aider, or custom scripts -- in its own Git worktree. A persistent daemon manages all sessions via Unix domain sockets, so they survive app restarts and crashes. Each worktree gets a built-in diff viewer and one-click opening in VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, or Xcode. Open source (Apache 2.0) with zero telemetry.

## What Is Conductor?

Conductor is a macOS app from Melty Labs (YC S24) for running Claude Code and Codex in parallel. It wraps agents via their SDKs rather than running raw CLI processes. A visual dashboard shows all active agents and their diffs. It integrates with Linear (create workspaces from issues) and GitHub (create PRs from the app). Closed source, free, Apple Silicon required.

## Key Differences

### Agent Flexibility

Superset is a terminal -- any process that runs in a shell runs in Superset. When a new CLI agent ships, you can use it immediately. Conductor wraps specific SDKs (Claude Code and Codex), so adding a new agent requires Conductor's team to build an integration. If you want to adopt new agents as they appear, Superset removes that bottleneck.

### Terminal Architecture

Superset runs a background daemon that owns all PTY sessions independently of the Electron app. Close Superset, reopen it, and your agents are still running. The daemon handles backpressure and priority-based concurrency (focused pane gets priority, background tabs hydrate gradually). Conductor's sessions persist when switching workspaces but do not survive app restarts -- a real limitation for long-running agent tasks.

### Openness and Privacy

Superset is open source (Apache 2.0) with no telemetry -- you can audit every line of code. Conductor is closed source. In mid-2025, it faced backlash over its GitHub integration requesting broad read-write access to entire GitHub accounts. They later added fine-grained access, but the incident highlighted the trust cost of closed-source tooling that handles source code.

### Workflow Integration

Conductor has a tighter built-in workflow for teams on Linear and GitHub: issue to workspace to PR, all in one app. Superset integrates with your editor instead (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, Xcode) and lets you review and merge however you prefer.

---

## Pricing

Superset offers a free tier and Pro at $20/seat/month. Conductor is free. Both require you to pay the underlying AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) for agent usage. The difference is flexibility: Superset lets you pick whichever agent offers the best price-performance per task, while Conductor limits you to Anthropic and OpenAI.

## Which Should You Choose?

**Choose Superset if you:**
- Use multiple CLI agents or want the freedom to adopt new ones instantly
- Need terminal sessions that survive app restarts and crashes
- Care about open source, code auditability, or zero telemetry
- Prefer reviewing code in your own editor (JetBrains, Xcode, VS Code, Cursor)

**Choose Conductor if you:**
- Primarily use Claude Code and want a polished SDK-level integration for it
- Use Linear for issue tracking and want a connected issue-to-PR workflow
- Prefer a visual dashboard for monitoring agent status at a glance

**Verdict:** Conductor fits Claude Code-centric teams on Linear and GitHub. Superset is the better long-term bet if you value agent flexibility, open source, and session persistence. New CLI agents ship every month; the tool that supports any agent by design has a structural advantage as the ecosystem evolves.

## FAQ

### Is Conductor open source?

No. Conductor is closed source from Melty Labs. You cannot inspect or audit the code. Superset is open source under Apache 2.0 with its full codebase on GitHub.

### Can Conductor run agents other than Claude Code?

Conductor supports Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. It does not support other CLI agents like OpenCode, Aider, or custom tools. Adding new agents requires Conductor to build an SDK integration.

### Do both tools use Git worktrees?

Yes. Both create isolated Git worktrees for each agent, giving every task its own branch and working directory. The underlying isolation mechanism is identical.
